"""Descriptive checks of the main runs that the paper reports beside the pre-registered tests.

Usage (after src.analysis.primary, whose units.csv it reads):
    python -m src.analysis.descriptive [--analysis results/analysis] [--results results/main] [--runs runs/grpo]

1. Rewards before an event. For every event, the training responses of the family that the judge accepted at
   the steps before the event's evaluation step (results/main/<run>/family_counts.csv, which counts every
   family response): how many rewarded responses a family had collected when it took over.
2. Acceptance by problem source. The hard pool is mostly DeepScaleR problems and the easy pool mostly MATH, so
   the H2 mechanism, the judge acceptance q and the advantage sqrt((1 - q) / q) of a rewarded response, is
   recomputed within each source: acceptance of the step-0 evaluation outputs of the core runs (all 200 of a
   run with their source, in runs/grpo/<run>/eval.jsonl, which is not committed), averaged over the seeds,
   next to each pool's share of DeepScaleR training problems (pools/pools-v1.json).

Writes rewards_before_event.csv and acceptance_by_source.csv to --analysis.
